## Definitions

> A network is represented as a graph, which shows links (if any) between each vertex (or node) and its neighbors.
> A line indicating a link between vertices is called an edge.
> A group of vertices that are mutually reachable by following edges on the graph is called a _component_.
> The edges followed from one node to another are called a _path_.

## Undirected Graph

## Directed Graph

## Analyzing Network Graphs
### Degree
### Betweenness
### Network Density
 A random graph generated using preferential attachment will always have the same network density score.

### Cliques
A clique is defined as a cluster of nodes where all possible edges are present.

### Components of a graph
 A group of connected nodes within a graph (that is, it's possible to reach any other vertex in the group) is referred to as a component .

### Random walk
